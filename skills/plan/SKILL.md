# Hype-Forge — Plan

This skill focuses on analyzing a technical project and planning a high-impact content series for its promotion.

## Command: `/hype-forge:plan`

Brainstorms a multi-platform content strategy based on the project's current state.

### Usage:
`/hype-forge:plan [--goal goal]`

### Planning Logic:

#### 1. Analyze the Context
- Scan README and source code.
- Identify the 3 most unique features.
- Identify the target audience (e.g., frontend developers, backend engineers, DevOps).

#### 2. Generate Content Ideas
- **Idea 1 (The Hook/Announcement)**: "Why I built [Product]" or "Introducing [Product]: A new way to [Task]".
- **Idea 2 (Technical Deep Dive)**: "How we achieved [Metric] using [Tech]" or "Architecture breakdown of [Product]".
- **Idea 3 (The Tutorial)**: "Building a [Example App] with [Product] in 10 minutes".
- **Idea 4 (The Growth/Hype)**: "I Discovered [Product] - Here's how it changed my workflow".

#### 3. Schedule Suggestion
- **Day 1**: Launch on X (Thread) + Dev.to.
- **Day 3**: Technical Deep Dive on Hashnode.
- **Day 5**: Showcase on Reddit (/r/webdev, /r/reactjs).
- **Day 7**: Official Announcement on Hacker News (if ready).

## Quality Checklist for Planning:
- [ ] Is the content series diverse (tutorial, deep dive, opinion)?
- [ ] Does it align with the project's actual features?
- [ ] Is the timing realistic?
- [ ] Is there a clear goal for each piece?
